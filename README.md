Welcome to the Simon Says Game! This project is a fun and interactive memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds as it gets progressively longer.

# Game Overview
The Simon Says Game challenges players to remember and repeat a series of tones and lights. The game starts with a single tone and light, and with each successful repetition, the sequence grows by one. Players must repeat the entire sequence correctly to advance to the next level.
